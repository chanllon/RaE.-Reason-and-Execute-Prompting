#Step by step solving geometry problems:

In this geometry problem, we have two parallel lines AB and CD, with a transversal EF intersecting AB at E and CD at F. A line segment EG bisects angle BEF and intersects CD at G. We are given that angle 1 (∠1) is 50°, and we need to find the measure of angle 2 (∠2).
The known variables are that AB is parallel to CD, ∠1 is 50°, and EG bisects ∠BEF. The unknown variable is the measure of ∠2.
Since AB∥CD and EF is a transversal, we can use properties of alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, and the angle bisector principle to find the unknown angle.
First, we need to establish the relationship between the given angles and ∠2. Then, by understanding that EG bisects ∠BEF, we can infer relationships between the angles formed.
Performing Calculations:
1.Since AB∥CD and EF is a transversal, ∠BEF and the angle formed by EF and CD (let's call it ∠EFD for clarification) are supplementary because they form a linear pair.
Knowing ∠1 is 50° and it's given as an alternate interior angle to ∠EFD (since AB∥CD and EF is a transversal), we can establish that ∠EFD also equals 50°.
2.Since EG bisects ∠BEF, it divides it into two equal parts. Let's denote the measure of each part as x. Therefore, ∠BEG = x and ∠GEF = x.
3.We can find x by understanding that ∠BEF + ∠EFD = 180° (linear pair). However, since ∠1 = 50° and it corresponds to ∠EFD (alternate interior angles are equal), we know ∠EFD is also 50°. This helps in establishing the entire angle ∠BEF = 180° - 50° = 130°. Since EG bisects ∠BEF, x = 130° / 2 = 65°.
4.Therefore, ∠BEG = x = 65°. Since ∠2 is an alternate interior angle to ∠BEG (with AB∥CD and EG as the transversal), ∠2 also equals 65° by the property of alternate interior angles.

This is our answer:65°



Q:As shown in the figure, the radii of two concentric circles are 4cm and 5cm respectively. If one chord AB of the larger circle is tangent to the smaller circle, then the length of chord AB is ()

#Step by step solving geometry problems:

In this problem, we need to determine the length of a chord that is tangent to two intersecting circles, one larger and one smaller. We are dealing with a geometric problem involving the Pythagorean theorem and properties of triangles.
We know the diameter OC of the larger circle is 4 centimeters, and the radius OA of the smaller circle is 5 centimeters. Given that OC⊥AB and AC=BC=1/2AB, we need to find the length of the chord AB.
We will use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. By constructing a right triangle and utilizing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the chord AB.
Connect OC and AO. Chord AB of the larger circle is tangent to the smaller circle. Since OC⊥AB, AC=BC=1/2AB.
Let's calculate the length of AB. Since OA=5cm and OC=4cm, in right triangle AOC, AC=sqrt(OA²-OC²)=3cm.AB=2*AC=6cm

This is our answer: 6
